## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to apply my HTML and CSS knowledge to make a site just from a picture alone. In other words I took a concept and turned it into a web site.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on responsive design since that's an area I'm lacking in. Also I want to focus more on making my sites feel nice and fluid that's why I'm looking forward to doing more challenges like this that will test my knowledge.
